# Database-app-project
Using the JDBC API for Java I created a UI for an Oracle SQL database project.
Due to time constraints for my class some sensitive information was coded into the file, and removed before being uploaded here.
This shows my code and UI, but no longer connects to the database.
https://youtu.be/bTVL6kg_T54 shows the app functioning

The SQL file included was used in the Oracle database that the app connected to, It shows the inserts, views, and PL/SQL used for this project.
